# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

This analysis of kickstarter data was conducted to determine how campaigns performed. Excel was employed to analyze over 4000 campaigns based on start dates and success or failure in meeting stated goals. The main focus of the analysis was campaigns that fell within the theater category, specifically plays.

### Purpose

The purpose of the analysis was to assist a new campaign in launching successfully and setting attainable goals. The campaign creator, Louise, wanted to know what she could do the ensure that her campaign did not fail.

## Analysis and Challenges

Data was analyzed, filtered, and sorted in the main worksheet before being separated out into individual pivot charts and pivot charts. These tools were employed to find trends among successful campaigns.

Using conditional formatting, the campaigns were sorted using color in order to quickly identify whether they succeeded, failed, or were cancelled. Since Louise planned to launch her campaign in the United States, the data was further filtered to only include those created in the US.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

It was determined that the month in which a campaign launches was indicative of its success. Those lunched in the late spring/early summer (May to July) had a much higher rate of success than those launched in any other month. Alternatively, it was more likely for a campaign to fail if it was launched in the late fall/winter (November, December, January, and March). In fact, campaigns launched in December were just as likely to fail as they were to succeed. It is thus recommended that Louise launch her campaign in May or June.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
